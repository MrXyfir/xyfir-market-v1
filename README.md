_A strictly structured, heavily automated marketplace subreddit with no fees and support for reputation, autobuy, and other useful features._

xyMarket may be revived in the future on Reddit, elsewhere, or as a standalone site, but for now it is abandoned.

This is the code for [u/xyMarketBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/xyMarketBot), the bot that ran [r/xyMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/xyMarket). You can view the archived documentation for it [here](https://github.com/Xyfir/Documentation/tree/master/_archives_/xyfir-market) (v0.2 and v1).

The code is public, but you are not free to use it for personal, commercial, or any other purposes. You may request permission to utilize all, or portions of this code [here](https://www.xyfir.com/contact).
